# Project Expedite

Project Expedite is my attempt to create solutions, algorithms, or solvers to classic puzzle games. There are a few principles I abide by when creating these algorithms.

## Principles

1. Efficiency - It is trivial to say that brute force searching can solve most problems, but where is the fun in that.

2. Elegance - The solution should be neat, clear, or clever in some specific way.

3. Robustness - The solution should be able to adapt to different "difficulty" levels of the game, whatever that may mean to the game, be it grid size or available options.
